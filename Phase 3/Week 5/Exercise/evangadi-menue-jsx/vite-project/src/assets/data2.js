    desc: `Simple, nutritious, and inexpensive, kinche is an Ethiopian breakfast staple made with cracked wheat that is boiled in either water or milk. The best way to describe kinche would be as the Ethiopian equivalent of oatmeal. After it has been cooked, kinche is added to the pan with either clarified spiced butter known as niter qibe or with oil and fried onions, although kinche can also be consumed without any flavorings.`,

    desc: `Made from the leanest meat, kitfo is viewed as a big treat by ordinary Ethiopians, while its nutritional powers are also praised. Similar to French steak tartare, the meat is minced and warmed in a pan with a little butter, mitmita (a stronger version of berbere) and sometimes thyme. Kitfo is typically served leb leb (warmed, not cooked), though you can ask for it to be betam leb leb (“very warmed,” which basically means cooked).`,

    desc: `If you don’t have a high tolerance for spicy food, then you’re going to be thankful for kik alicha. It refers to an Ethiopian lentil stew made from split peas, niter kibbeh, and turmeric. Unlike many of the dishes in this Ethiopian food guide, it isn’t made with any berbere so it isn’t nearly as spicy as dishes like doro wat and siga wat.Kik alicha is a mildly flavored stew made with yellow split peas simmered with garlic, onions, ginger, turmeric, and niter kibbeh. It’s a popular type of vegetarian stew that’s often served as part of a combination platter. Like any wat, it’s best enjoyed with injera.`,
